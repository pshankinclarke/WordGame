# WordGame

A comprehensive strategy for teaching children to spell, incorporates visual memory, spelling memory,pre-communicative writing and multiple spelling stages. To this end, this word game provides an educational tool in the form of a game that may provide benefits for children's visual and spelling memory. Visual memory or "orthographic" memory is a child's ability to memorize letter sequences by recognizing word structure, the meaningful parts of words, and  a word's relationship to other words. The theme for this game is a "word jumble" where a child is given a jumble of letters and then has to decipher the jumble letter by letter. The game is challening and may be suitable for more advanced children, perhaps in advance of a spelling compeition. However the number of characters is capped at 7, which provides an upper bound on the difficulty of the game. Designing the UI was the major challenge in designing this game due to the fact that it needed to integrate text,sound,raw images, and buttons. The theme of the game reflects its educational purpose. The game is diplayed on a chalkboard, with matching chalk font, and a chalk eraser sound effect that is triggered when a new word appears. A new word appears when the player presses the erase button on the bottom of the screen. The player is told what letter he is currently guessing by it being highlighted in red. The assets that I used for the background, font, and sound affects can be found at :
